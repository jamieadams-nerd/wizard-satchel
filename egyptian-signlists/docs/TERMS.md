# Project Terminology



## Key terminology (what is correct and accepted)

These terms are safe, standard, and widely used in the Egyptological community:

Core concepts

- Egyptian hieroglyphs (plural, lowercase “h”)
- Gardiner sign list (or Gardiner’s Sign List)
- Gardiner code (e.g. A1, D36)
- Unicode Egyptian Hieroglyphs block
- JSesh (the software, capital S)
- Sign (preferred over “glyph” in scholarly contexts)
- Sign list (very important term)
- Transliteration (not translation)
- Encoding / representation

Very important distinction
- Sign ≠ glyph
  - Sign = conceptual hieroglyphic unit
  - Glyph = a particular visual rendering

You are already doing sign-level work, not typography — that’s good.

## Terms to avoid or use carefully

These won’t offend, but they may make experts skeptical:

Term	Why
“glyph” (as primary term)	Feels typographic, not linguistic
“font”	Too narrow
“character” (without context)	Unicode-specific, ambiguous
“symbol”	Vague
“translation”	Incorrect for what you’re doing

Use these only with qualifiers, e.g.:

“Unicode character encoding of hieroglyphic signs”

Inside this "satchel" you may find shell scripts, bash configuration fragments, tiny utilities, traditional how-to notes, and practical tips and tricks. Some pieces are polished, others are delightfully scrappy, and most exist because they solved a problem well enough that it was worth keeping them close.

This is not a framework, a library, or an attempt at a grand design. Think of it as a well-worn pouch at a wizard’s side: a mix of reliable tools, simple incantations, and straightforward instructions you might pull out when someone says, “What’s the cleanest way to do this again?”

As with any collected magic, not every item will behave the same in every environment. Shells differ, distributions have opinions, policies and permissions can get in the way, and hardened systems may require small adjustments. Nothing here is meant to be applied blindly — read, adapt, and test in your own realm.

If you spend time in terminals, Linux or Unix systems, or environments where useful beats flashy, you may find a few things here worth adding to your own satchel.
